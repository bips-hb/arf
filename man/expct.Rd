expct(
  params,

  evidence = NULL,
  evidence_row_mode = c("separate", "or"),

}
\arguments{
\item{params}{Circuit parameters learned via \code{\link{forde}}.}

\item{query}{Optional character vector of variable names. Estimates will be
computed for each. If \code{NULL}, all variables other than those in
\code{evidence} will be estimated. If \code{evidence} contains \code{NA}s,
those values will be imputed and a full dataset is returned.}

\item{evidence}{Optional set of conditioning events. This can take one of
three forms: (1) a partial sample, i.e. a single row of data with
some but not all columns; (2) a data frame of conditioning events,
which allows for inequalities and intervals; or (3) a posterior
distribution over leaves. See Details and Examples.}

\item{evidence_row_mode}{Interpretation of rows in multi-row evidence. If
\code{"separate"}, each row in \code{evidence} is a unique conditioning
event for which \code{n_synth} synthetic samples are generated. If
\code{"or"}, the rows are combined with a logical OR. See Examples.}

\item{round}{Round continuous variables to their respective maximum precision
in the real data set?}

\item{nomatch}{What to do if no leaf matches a condition in \code{evidence}?
Options are to force sampling from a random leaf (\code{"force"}) or return
\code{NA} (\code{"na"}). The default is \code{"force"}.}

\item{cat_prob}{Return expected probabilities instead of expected categories
for categorical data? So far, only implemented for integers (returns the
probability of the first factor level).}

\item{verbose}{Show warnings, e.g. when no leaf matches a condition?}

\item{stepsize}{How many rows of evidence should be handled at each step?
Defaults to \code{nrow(evidence) / num_registered_workers} for
\code{parallel == TRUE}.}

\item{parallel}{Compute in parallel? Must register backend beforehand, e.g.
via \code{doParallel} or \code{doFuture}; see Examples.}
}
\value{
A one row data frame with values for all query variables.
}
\description{
Compute the expectation of some query variable(s), optionally conditioned
on some event(s).
}
\details{
This function computes expected values for any subset of features, optionally
conditioned on some event(s).

There are three methods for (optionally) encoding conditioning events via the
\code{evidence} argument. The first is to provide a partial sample, where
some columns from the training data are missing or set to \code{NA}. The
second is to provide a data frame with condition events. This supports
inequalities and intervals. Alternatively, users may directly input a
pre-calculated posterior distribution over leaves, with columns \code{f_idx}
and \code{wt}. This may be preferable for complex constraints. See Examples.

Please note that results for continuous features which are both included in
\code{query} and in \code{evidence} with an interval condition are currently
inconsistent.

# Train ARF and estimate leaf parameters
arf <- adversarial_rf(iris)
psi <- forde(arf, iris)

# What is the expected value of Sepal.Length?
expct(psi, query = "Sepal.Length")

# What if we condition on Species = "setosa"?
evi <- data.frame(Species = "setosa")
expct(psi, query = "Sepal.Length", evidence = evi)

# Compute expectations for all features other than Species
expct(psi, evidence = evi)

# Condition on Species = "setosa" and Petal.Width > 0.3
evi <- data.frame(Species = "setosa", 
                  Petal.Width = ">0.3")
expct(psi, evidence = evi)

# Condition on first two rows with some missing values
evi <- iris[1:2,]
evi[1, 1] <- NA_real_
evi[1, 5] <- NA_character_
evi[2, 2] <- NA_real_
x_synth <- expct(psi, evidence = evi)
